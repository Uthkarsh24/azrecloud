1. Define the Problem and Objectives
Clearly define the problem you want to solve and the expected outcome.
Set measurable objectives, such as improving customer response time or enhancing user engagement.
2. Select Azure Services
3.Azure OpenAI Service: Use this service to leverage large language models like GPT for natural language processing tasks.
Other Complementary Services Azure Cognitive Services (e.g., Speech, Vision, Text Analytics) to add additional AI capabilities.
Azure Machine Learning for custom model training, experimentation, and deployment.
Azure Data Lake Storage or Azure Blob Storage for data storage.
Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions for orchestration and automation.
4. Provision the Azure OpenAI Service
Go to the Azure portal and search for "Azure OpenAI".
Create an Azure OpenAI resource by selecting the appropriate subscription, resource group, and region.
Choose a pricing tier that fits your requirements.
5. Data Preparation
Collect and preprocess the data you need for your solution. For text-based tasks, data could include chat logs, documents, or customer reviews.
Store your data securely in Azure Blob Storage or Data Lake.
6. Develop the AI Model
Using Pre-trained Models: Azure OpenAI offers pre-trained models like GPT-3, Codex, or other versions of GPT. These models can be used for generating text, answering questions, summarization, etc.
Fine-tuning: If required, you can fine-tune these models using Azure Machine Learning and your specific dataset.
